# ImageSegmentation With Unet2d
> This is an example of Medical Image Ceil Segment

## Prerequisities
The following dependencies are needed:
- numpy >= 1.11.1
- SimpleITK >=1.0.1
- opencv-python >=3.3.0
- tensorflow-gpu ==1.8.0
- pandas >=0.20.1
- scikit-learn >= 0.17.1

## How to Use

The image files path is in the csv files, and put the image on the path, use the `glandceilunet2dtest.py` file to train the model. 

Training the model on the GTX1080, it take 20 hours, and i also attach the trained model in the project, you also just use the `glandceilunet2dtest.py` file to predict, and get the segmentation result.
